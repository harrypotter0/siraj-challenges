# AI_In_Marketing
This is the code for "AI in Marketing" by Siraj Raval on Youtube 

## Overview

This is the code for [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYMjXD3G__Y&lc=z23hgfkpdnfjyt0n1acdp431kuaxfkhbz5py54gjhedw03c010c) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval about AI Marketing. 

## Usage

The jupyter notebook can be viewed directly inside of github. The code samples require keras and tensorrec as dependencies respectively. Both can be installed via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/). [Here](https://github.com/jfkirk/tensorrec) is the tensorrec repository.


## Credits

Credits go to Francois Chollet and Tensorrec. I've merely created a wrapper to get people started.
