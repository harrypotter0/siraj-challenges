    "- A supply chain is a network between a company and its suppliers to produce and distribute a specific product, and the supply chain represents the steps it takes to get the product or service to the customer. \n",
    "- Supply chain management is a crucial process because an optimized supply chain results in lower costs and a faster production cycle.\n",
    "- Supply chains are hugely important in our world of physical goods. Companies invest a lot of money and effort to continually optimize and improve them, and that’s not likely to ever stop. \n",
    "- Save 5% on transportation costs? That’s a big deal.\n",
    "- A supply chain management system can reduce the cost and complexity of the manufacturing process, particularly for a manufacturer that uses many parts. \n",
    "- 1 A clothing manufacturer will move raw materials into production first. \n",
    "- 2 The manufacturer then incurs labor costs to run machinery and perform other work using the materials.\n",
    "- 3 Once the items are completed, they must be packaging and stored until they are sold to a customer. \n",

    "- They run complex engines at each step in the process and at each node in the supply network\n",
    "- They are usually in conflict with other functions and/or partners\n",
    "- They miss huge opportunities hidden in the network because they are locally sub optimized\n",
    "- They work on stale data and thus promote bad decisions\n",

    "- 1 Access to Real-Time Data. \n",
    "- Most supply chains today attempt to execute plans using data that is days old, but this results in poor decision-making that sub-optimizes the supply chain\n",
    "- 2 Access to Community (Multi-Party) Data (data outside of an enterprise is highly useful)\n",
    "- 3 Support for Network-Wide Objective Functions\n",
    "- AI solutions must support global consumer-driven objectives even when faced with constraints within the supply chain\n",
    "- 4 Decision Process Must Be Incremental and Consider the Cost of Change\n",
    "- An AI tool must consider trade-offs in terms of cost of change against incremental benefits when making decisions.\n",
    "- 5 Decision Process Must Be Continuous, Self-Learning and Self-Monitoring\n",

    "-  Significant value can only be achieved if the algorithm can not only make intelligent decisions but can also execute them. \n",
    "- 7 AI Engines Must Be Highly Scalable\n",
    "- Large community supply chains can have millions if not hundreds of millions of stocking locations. AI solutions must be able to make smart decisions, fast, and on a massive scale.\n",
    "- 8. Must Have a Way for Users to Engage with the System\n",
    "- AI should not operate in a “black box.” The UI must give users visibility to decision criteria, propagation impact, and enable them to understand issues that the AI system cannot solve\n",

Coupled with the vast amount of underutilized data supply chains generate and theres MASSIVE potential for disruption. AI + IOT + blockchain = an autonomous supply chain (self-aware, self-governing and self-determining)\n",
